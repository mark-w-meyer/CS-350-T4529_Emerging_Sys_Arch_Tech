# CS-350-T4529_Emerging_Sys_Arch_Tech
A repository of embedded systems artifacts using a Ti SimpleLink CC3220SF MCU. All code was created using Ti Code Composer Studio.

Milestone One

This milestone was solving the problem of implementing a pulse width modulator (PWM). The objective was to blink two LEDs at alternating duty cycles in a loop. What I do particularly well in this milestone is commenting the purpose of each component and keeping the code simple. Where I could improve would be to create a function that updates the duty cycle and make function calls in main to further simplify the code for future expansion of the program. The tools and resources I am adding to my support network are implementing a PWM--which is frequently used in embedded systems engineering--and furthering my experience in using handles and data types such as uint16_t and uint32_t. 

Given the limited space of embedded systems, it is important to become familiar with these data types as well as the handles provided in working with a given manufacturer's product. In this case, since I'm using a Ti MCU, I am programming with a Ti Code Composer Studio, so I am implementing their provided handles to achieve functionality of their product. The skills from this milestone that will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work will be adapting to a new environment, increasing my experience in embedded systems implementations, and familiarity with Texas Instruments' microcontrollers and IDE. I made this milestone maintainable, readable, and adaptable by commenting the code well and spacing out the functionality as to easily decipher where important changes in the code are being made such that a future developer could immediately pick up its purpose and intent.
